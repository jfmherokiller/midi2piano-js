# midi2spu

i dont know how to format these readmes but here goes:

this is my midi2spu project it takes a midifile and converts it into a correctly formatted spu text file. 
As of right now its pretty stupid because it pretty much dumps the midi notes into the spu file.

if you want to try it out in its current form look here
